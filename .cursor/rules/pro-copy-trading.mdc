# Pro Copy Trading Platform Standards

KLINEO is a **professional copy trading platform**. All code and docs must meet expert-level standards.

## Security (non-negotiable)
- Never trust client-supplied `user_id` or identity; use JWT `req.user.id` only.
- Any order placement (strategy runner, futures, future copy engine) must check the global kill switch and user/connection risk limits.
- Exchange API keys: encrypted at rest; never log or return raw secrets.

## Terminology (consistent)
- Use **Master Trader** (not "bot" in user-facing copy unless intended).
- Use **Copy Trader** for followers; **copy setup** for configuration; **allocation** for %.
- **Demo** vs **Live** must be clearly labeled everywhere.

## Copy trading scope
- **Copy setups** = configuration (who to copy, allocation %, pause/stop). Fully implemented.
- **Copy execution engine** = service that mirrors master trades to followers' exchanges. Not yet implemented; when added, it must use kill switch and risk checks.
- Do not promise "trades replicate in real time" in a way that implies execution is already live unless it is. Prefer "configure copy trading" or "when copy execution is active."

## New features checklist
- Entitlement: new copy/trading features must respect joining fee + allowance unless admin bypass.
- UX: no placeholder or mock text in production; numbers (PnL, %) from real or clearly synthetic data.
- Docs: update `docs/PRO_COPY_TRADING_STANDARDS.md` and `docs/KLINEO_HIGH_LEVEL_OVERVIEW.md` when adding major capabilities.
